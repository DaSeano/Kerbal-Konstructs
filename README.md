Kerbal Konstructs
=================

What is it?
-----------
Kerbal Konstructs is a reimplementation of the popular [KerbTown](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40374-WIP-KerbTown-v0-13-Beta-Place-static-buildings-cities-launch-sites-more!) mod by Razchek. The goal is to remain completely compatible with KerbTown asset packs while also providing optimizations that are not present in the original mod.

FAQ

**Why not just contribute to KerbTown?**

The only real reason that this is a standalone mod instead of a fork of KerbTown is that I wanted to respect the original authors of KerbTown and not add features to their mod that they wouldn't agree with. By having my own mod I am given full freedom to add whatever crazy ideas I might come up with.

**Why should I use this instead of KerbTown?**

You can use whatever you prefer, asset packs for either mod should work together seamlessly as I am trying to maintain full compatibility with KerbTown. Some advantages of using this mod though are that you get to take advantage of my optimizations that solve the Krakensbane lag issue in KerbTown described [here](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82785-0-24-x-Kerbin-Side-v0-34-Now-With-More-Crate?p=1247712&viewfull=1#post1247712) (I have simple version of this in my fork of KerbTown [here](https://github.com/medsouz/KerbTown)) as well as whatever additional features I add in the future.
